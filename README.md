# Probabilistic Machine Learning

## Main objective
Benchmark a Variational Inference implementation against MCMC in estimating a posterior model, predictive
performance and computational performance in terms of time.
Since clinical data analyses commonly employ logistic regression, we chose this
approach for comparative purposes.
## Dataset
We analysed Type 2 Diabetes data. The response variable is “diagnosed type 2
diabetes”. The predictors are all continuous variables (Pregnancies, Glucose,
BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigree, Age). Size: 768

## Predictive model
Since clinical data analyses commonly employ logistic regression, we chose this approach for comparative purposes.
